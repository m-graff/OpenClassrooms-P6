# Welcome to this project, "So Pekocko" website !

This is an exercice as part of my developer training for OpenClassrooms. This is also the first time i fully explore the wonderful world of Backends techs !

## How to make this project work:

As it is kinda hard to install this version nowadays, you can use NVM in order to have a fully acces to any nodeJS version you want. Go to this repo and install it [here](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) !

Once it's done: 

### Go to the frontend folder
Open your terminal and run : 
nvm use 10.0.0
npm start

### Go to he backend folder 
Open your terminal and run :
nvm use 12.14
npm start
