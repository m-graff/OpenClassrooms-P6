## Welcome to this project, "So Pekocko" website ! 

This is an exercice as part of my developer training for OpenClassrooms. This is also the first time i fully explore the wonderful world of Backends techs !

----

### How to make this project work:

As it is kinda hard to install this version nowadays, you can use NVM in order to have a fully acces to any nodeJS version you want. Go to this repo and install it [here](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) !

Once it's done: 

#### Go to the backend folder 
Open your terminal and run :  
nvm use 12.14  
npm start  

#### Go to the frontend folder  
Open your terminal and run :   
nvm use 10.0.0  
npm start
